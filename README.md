Abstract – Wrong Ergonomics is a major problem that’s bothering
the IT industry. Workplace posture like sitting, hand position on
keyboard, foot rest position etc, all determine the ergonomics of an
employee. We are building an app, ErgoPerfecto which provides
the employee with his/her own recommendations of ergonomic
products, postures and exercises he/she must do to avoid
inconveniences while working. ErgoPerfecto mainly takes the
information about an employee's physical health and gives
suggestions of exercises to the employee. A one place solution,
where the employee can keep track of physiotherapy sessions
he/she attended and can log exercises his/her therapist
recommended. A google extension has also been built to let the app
provide push notifications to the employee reminding him/her the
proper postures and exercises he/she should do. The app also
provides feedback from other employees who faced ergonomic
issues and the exercises they used to overcome the pain.
ErgoPerfecto also provides a chatbot to assist the user.
